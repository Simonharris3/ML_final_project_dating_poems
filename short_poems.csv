erring man the year and oft disgracd the pride of schools before their course was known full in its causes and effects to him allpiercing sage who sat not down and dreamd romantic schemes defended by the din of specious words and tyranny of names but bidding his amazing mind attend and with heroic patience years on years deepsearching saw at last the system dawn and shine of all his race on him alone   what were his raptures then how pure how strong and what the triumphs of old greece and rome by his diminishd but the pride of boys in some small fray victorious when instead of shatterd parcels of this earth usurpd by violence unmanly and sore deeds of cruelty and blood nature herself stood all subdud by him and open laid her every latent glory to his view   all intellectual eye our solarround first gazing through he by the blended power of gravitation and projection saw the whole in silent harmony revolve from unassisted vision hid the moons to cheer remoter planets numerous pourd by him in all their mingled tracts were seen he also fixd the wandering queen of night whether she wanes into a scanty orb or waxing broad with her pale shadowy light in a soft deluge overflows the sky her every motion cleardiscerning he adjusted to the mutual main and taught why now the mighty mass of water swells resistless heaving on the broken rocks and the full river turning till again the tide revertive unattracted leaves a yellow waste of idle sands behind   then breaking hence he took his ardent flight through the blue infinite and every star which the clear concave of a winters night pours on the eye or astronomic tube farstretching snatches from the dark abyss or such as farther in successive skies to fancy shine alone at his approach blazd into suns the living centre each of an harmonious system all combind and ruld unerring by that single power which draws the stone projected to the ground   o unprofuse magnificence divine o wisdom truly perfect thus to call from a

simplicity restord the schools astonishd stood but found it vain to keep at odds with demonstration strong and unawakend dream beneath the blaze of truth at once their pleasing visions fled with the gay shadows of the morning mixd when newton rose our philosophic sun th arial flow of sound was known to him from whence it first in wavy circles breaks till the touchd organ takes the message in nor could the darting beam of speed immense escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye evn light itself which every thing displays shone undiscoverd till his brighter mind untwisted all the shining robe of day and from the whitening undistinguishd blaze collecting every ray into his kind to the charmd eye educd the gorgeous train of parent colours first the flaming red sprung vivid forth the tawny orange next and next delicious yellow by whose side fell the kind beams of allrefreshing green then the pure blue that swells autumnal skies ethereal played and then of sadder hue emergd the deepend

waste of time let no weak drop be shed for him the virgin in her bloom cut off the joyous youth and darling child these are the tombs that claim the tender tear and elegiac song but newton calls for other notes of gratulation high that now he wanders through those endless worlds he here so well descried and wondering talks and hymns their author with his glad compeers   o britains boast whether with angels thou sittest in dread discourse or fellowblest who joy to see the honour of their kind or whether mounted on cherubic wing thy swift career is with the whirling orbs comparing things with

see winter comes to rule the varied year  sullen and sad with all his rising train vapours and clouds and storms be these my theme these that exalt the soul to solemn thought and heavenly musing welcome kindred glooms  wishd wintry horrors hail  with frequent foot pleasd have i in my cheerful morn of life when nursd by careless solitude i livd and sung of nature with unceasing joy pleasd have i wanderd thro your rough domains  trod the pure virgin snows my self as pure heard the winds roar and the big torrent burst or seen the deep fermenting tempest brewd in the red evening sky  thus passd the time till thro the opening chambers of the south  lookd out the joyous spring lookd out and smild thee too inspirer of the toiling swain fair autumn yellow robd ill sing of thee of thy last temperd days and sunny calms when all the golden hours are on the wing  attending thy retreat and round thy wain slowrolling onward to the southern sky  behold the wellpoisd hornet hovering hangs with quivering pinions in the genial blaze flys off in airy circles then returns  and hums and dances to the beating ray nor shall the man that musing walks alone and heedless strays within his radiant lists go unchastisd away  sometimes a fleece of clouds widescattering with a lucid veil  soft shadow oer thunruffled face of heaven and thro their dewy sluices shed the sun with temperd influence down then is the time for those whom wisdom and whom nature charm to steal themselves from the degenerate croud  and soar above this little scene of things to tread lowthoughted vice beneath their feet to lay their passions in a gentle calm and woo lone quiet in her silent walks  now solitary and in pensive guise  oft let me wander oer the russet mead or thro the pining grove where scarce is heard one dying strain to chear the woodmans toil sad philomel perchance pours forth her plaint far thro the withering copse mean while the leaves  that late the forest clad with lively green nipt by the drizzly night and sallowhud fall wavering thro the air or shower amain urgd by the breeze that sobs amid the boughs then listning hares forsake the rusling woods  and starting at the frequent noise escape to the rough stubble and the rushy fen then woodcocks oer the fluctuating main that glimmers to the glimpses of the moon stretch their long voyage to the woodland glade  where wheeling with uncertain flight they mock the nimble fowlers aim  now nature droops languish the living herbs with pale decay and all the various family of flowers their sunny robes resign the falling fruits  thro the still night forsake the parentbough that in the first grey glances of the dawn looks wild and wonders at the wintry waste  the year yet pleasing but declining fast soft oer the secret soul in gentle gales  a philosophic melancholly breathes and bears the swelling thought aloft to heaven then forming fancy rouses to conceive what never mingled with the vulgars dream then wake the tender pang the pitying tear  the sigh for suffering worth the wish preferd for humankind the joy to see them blessd and all the social offspring of the heart  oh bear me then to high embowering shades to twilight groves and visionary vales  to weeping grottos and to hoary caves where angelforms are seen and voices heard sighd in low whispers that abstract the soul from outward sense far into worlds remote  now when the western sun withdraws the day  and humid evening gliding oer the sky in her chill progress checks the straggling beams and robs them of their gatherd vapoury prey where marshes stagnate and where rivers wind cluster the rolling fogs and swim along  the duskymantled lawn then slow descend once more to mingle with their watry friends the vivid stars shine out in radiant files and boundless ether glows till the fair moon shows her broad visage in the crimsond east  now stooping seems to kiss the passing cloud now oer the pure cerulean rides sublime wide the pale deluge floats with silver waves oer the skyd mountain to the lowlaid vale from the white rocks with dim reflexion gleams  and faintly glitters thro the waving shades  all night abundant dews unnoted fall and at return of morning silver oer the face of motherearth from every branch depending tremble the translucent gems  and quivering seem to fall away yet cling and sparkle in the sun whose rising eye with fogs bedimd portends a beauteous day  now giddy youth whom headlong passions fire rouse the wild game and stain the guiltless grove  with violence and death yet call it sport to scatter ruin thro the realms of love and peace that thinks no ill but these the muse whose charity unlimited extends as wide as nature works disdains to sing  returning to her nobler theme in view   for see where winter comes himself confest striding the gloomy blast first rains obscure drive thro the mingling skies with tempest foul beat on the mountains brow and shake the woods  that sounding wave below the dreary plain lies overwhelmd and lost the bellying clouds combine and deepening into night shut up the days fair face the wanderers of heaven each to his home retire save those that love  to take their pastime in the troubled air and skimming flutter round the dimply flood the cattle from thuntasted fields return and ask with meaning low their wonted stalls or ruminate in the contiguous shade  thither the houshold feathery people croud the crested cock with all his female train pensive and wet mean while the cottageswain hangs oer thenlivening blaze and taleful there recounts his simple frolic much he talks  and much he laughs nor recks the storm that blows without and rattles on his humble roof  at last the muddy deluge pours along resistless roaring dreadful down it comes from the chapt mountain and the mossy wild  tumbling thro rocks abrupt and sounding far then oer the sanded valley floating spreads calm sluggish silent till again constraind betwixt two meeting hills it bursts a way where rocks and woods oerhang the turbid stream  there gathering triple force rapid and deep it boils and wheels and foams and thunders thro  nature great parent whose directing hand rolls round the seasons of the changeful year how mighty how majestick are thy works  with what a pleasing dread they swell the soul that sees astonishd and astonishd sings you too ye winds that now begin to blow with boisterous sweep i raise my voice to you where are your stores ye viewless beings say  where your aerial magazines reservd against the day of tempest perilous in what untraveld country of the air hushd in still silence sleep you when tis calm  late in the louring sky red fiery streaks  begin to flush about the reeling clouds stagger with dizzy aim as doubting yet which master to obey while rising slow sad in the leadencolourd east the moon wears a bleak circle round her sullyd orb  then issues forth the storm with loud control and the thin fabrick of the pillard air

toils and climbs against the blast  low waves the rooted forest vexd and sheds what of its leafy honours yet remains thus struggling thro the dissipated grove  the whirling tempest raves along the plain and on the cottage thacht or lordly dome keenfastening shakes em to the solid base sleep frighted flies the hollow chimney howls the windows rattle and the hinges creak   then too they say thro all the burthend air long groans are heard shrill sounds and distant sighs that murmurd by the demon of the night warn the devoted wretch of woe and death wild uproar lords it wide the clouds commixt  with stars swiftgliding sweep along the sky all nature reels  but hark the almighty speaks instant the chidden storm begins to pant and dies at once into a noiseless calm  as yet tis midnights reign

farewell lovd youth since twas the will of heaven  so soon to take what had so late been givn  and thus our expectations to destroy  raising a grief where we had formd a joy  who once believd it was the fates design  in him to double an illustrious line  and in a second channel spread that race  where evry virtue shines with every grace  but we mistook and twas not here below  that this engrafted scion was to grow  the seats above requird him that each sphere  might soon the offspring of such parents share resign him then to the supream intent  you who but flesh to that blest spirit lent  again disrobd let him to bliss retire  and only bear from you amidst that choir  what precept or example did inspire  a title to rewards from that rich store  of pious works which you have sent before  then lay the fading reliques which remain  in the still vault excluding farther pain  where kings and counsellors their progress close  and his renowned ancestors repose  where coventry withdrew all but in name  leaving the world his benefits and fame  where his paternal predecessor lies  once large of thought and rankd among the wise  whose genius in longleat we may behold  a pile as noble as if hed been told  by weymouth it shoud be in time possest  and strove to suit the mansion to the guest  nor favourd nor disgracd there essex sleeps  nor somerset his masters sorrows weeps  who to the shelter of th unenvyd grave  conveyd the monarch whom he coud not save  though romanlike his own lessvalud head  he profferd in that injurd martyrs stead  nor let that matchless female scape my pen  who their whole duty taught to weaker men  and of each sex the two best gifts enjoyd  the skill to write the modesty to hide  whilst none shoud that performance disbelieve  who led the life might the directions give  with such as these whence he derivd his blood  great on record or eminently good  let him be laid till deaths long night shall cease  and breaking glory interrupt the peace  meanwhile ye living parents ease your grief  by tears allowd as natures due relief  for when we offer to the powrs above  like you the dearest objects of our love  when with that patient saint in holy writ  weve learnt at once to grieve and to submit  when contrite sighs like hallowd incense rise  bearing our anguish to th appeased skies  then may those showrs which take from sorrow birth  and still are tending towrd this baleful earth  oer all our deep and parching cares diffuse  like edens springs or hermons softning dews   but lend your succours ye almighty powrs  for as the wound the balsam too is yours  in vain are numbers or persuasive speech  what poets write or what the pastors teach  till you who make again repair the breach  for when to shades of death our joys are fled  when for a loss like this our tears are shed  none can revive the heart but who can raise the dead  but yet my muse if thou hadst softer verse  than eer bewaild the melancholy herse  if thou hadst powr to dissipate the gloom  inherent to the solitary tomb  to rescue thence the memory and air  of what we lately saw so fresh so fair  then shoud this noble youth thy art engage  to shew the beauties of his blooming age  the pleasing light that from his eyes was cast  like hasty beams too vigorous to last  where the warm soul as on the confines lay  ready for flight and for eternal day  gently disposd his nature shoud be shown  and all the mothers sweetness made his own  the fathers likeness was but faintly seen  as ripend fruits are figurd by the green  nor coud we hope had he fulfilld his days  he shoud have reachd weymouths unequald praise  still one distinguishd plant each lineage shews  and all the rest beneath its stature grows  of tullys race but he possessd the tongue  and none like julius from the caesars sprung  next in his harmless sports he shoud be drawn  urging his courser oer the flowry lawn  sprightly himself as the enlivend game  bold in the chace and full of genrous flame  yet in the palace tractable and mild  perfect in all the duties of a child  which fond reflection pleases whilst it pains  like penetrating notes of sad harmonious strains  selected friendships timely he began  and siezed in youth that best delight of man  leaving a growing race to mourn his end  their earliest and their ages promisd friend  but far away alas that prospect moves  lost in the clouds like distant hills and groves  whilst with encreasing steps we all pursue  what time alone can bring to nearer view  that future state which darkness yet involves  known but by death which evry doubt resolves ,16
you have obeyd you winds that must fulfill  the great disposers righteous will  throughout the land unlimited you flew  nor sought as heretofore with friendly aid  only new motion to bestow  upon the

who on mountains chose to rise  and drew them nearer to the skies  or you whom valleys late did hold  in flexible and lighter mould  you numrous brethren of the leafy kind  to whatsoever use designd  now vain you found it to contend  with not alas one element your friend  your mother earth thro long preceding rains  which undermining sink below  no more her wonted strength retains  nor you so fixd

destructive this imperious wind  that checkd your nobler aims and gives you to the fire    thus have thy cedars libanus been struck  as the lythe oziers twisted round  thus cadez has thy wilderness been shook  when the appalling and tremendous sound  of rattling tempests oer you broke  and made your stubborn glories bow  when in such whirlwinds the almighty spoke  warning judea then as our

round his eyes in vain to reach the bound  which jordans flood sets to his fertile ground  countless his flocks whilst lebanon contains  a herd as large kept by his numerous swains  that fill with

egypts sea  thy heart with love thy temples with renown  th allgiving hand of heavn did largely crown  whilst yet thy cheek was spread with youthful down  what more coud craving man of god implore  or what for favourd man coud god do more  yet coud not these nor israels throne suffice  intemprate wishes drawn thro wandring eyes   one beauty not thy own and seen by chance  melts down the work of

race pursue  and in revolted israels scornful view  thy captivd wives shall be in triumph led  unto a bold usurpers shameful bed  who from thy bowels sprung shall seize thy throne  and scourge thee by

daphnes answer to sylvia declaring she should esteem all as enemies  who should talk to her of love  then to the snowy ewe in thy esteem  the father of the flock a foe must seem  the faithful turtles to their yielding mates  the cheerful spring which love and joy creates  that reconciles the world by soft desires  and tender thoughts in evry breast inspires  to you a hateful season must appear  whilst love prevails and all are lovers here  observe the gentle murmurs of that dove  and see how billing she confirms her love  for this the nightingale displays her throat  and love love love is all her evning note  the very tygers have their tender hours  and prouder lyons bow beneath loves powrs  thou prouder yet than that imperious beast  alone denyst him shelter in thy breast  but why should i the creatures only name  that sense partake as owners of this flame  love farther goes nor stops his course at these  the plants he moves and gently bends the trees  see how those willows mix their amrous boughs  and how that vine clasps her supporting spouse  the silver firr dotes on the stately pine  by love those elms by love those beeches join   but view that oak behold his rugged side  yet that rough bark the melting flame dos hide  all by their trembling leaves in sighs declare  and tell their passions to the gathring air  which had but love oer thee the least command  thou by their motions too mightst understand     amintor being askd by thirsis  who is the object of his love  speaks as follows  amint thirsis to thee i mean that name to show  which only yet our groves and

sighing wish were he alive and mine  but mark me to the end thir go on for well i do thy speech attend  perhaps to better ends than yet thou knowst  amint being now a child or but a youth at most  when scarce to reach the blushing fruit i knew  which on the lowest bending branches grew  still with the dearest sweetest kindest maid  young as myself at childish sports i playd  the fairest sure of all that lovely kind  who spread their golden tresses to the wind  cydippes daughter and montanos heir  whose flocks and herds so numrous do appear  the beauteous sylvia she tis she i love  warmth of all hearts and pride of evry grove  with her i livd no turtles eer so fond  our houses met but more our souls were joind  together nets for fish and fowl we laid  together through the spacious forest strayd  pursud with equal speed the flying deer  and of the spoils there no divisions were  but whilst i from the beasts their freedom won  alas i know not how my own was gone  by unperceivd degrees the fire encreasd  which filld at last each corner of my breast  as from a root tho scarce discernd so small  a plant may rise that grows amazing tall  from sylvias presence now i could not move  and from her eyes took in full draughts of love  which sweetly thro my ravishd mind distilld  yet in the end such bitterness woud yield  that oft i sighd ere yet i knew the cause  and was a lover ere i dreamd i was  but oh at last too well my state i knew  and now will shew thee how this passion grew  then listen while the pleasing tale i tell     thirsis persuades amintor not to despair upon the  redictions of mopsus discovring him to be an impostor  thirsis why dost thou still give way to such despair  amintor too just alas the weighty causes are  mopsus wise mopsus who in art excels  and of all plants the secret vertue tells  knows with what healing gifts our springs abound  and of each bird explains the mystick sound  twas he evn he my wretched fate foretold  thir dost thou this speech then of that mopsus hold  who whilst his smiles attract the easy view  drops flattring words soft as the falling dew  whose outward form all friendly still appears  tho fraud and daggers in his thoughts he wears  and the unwary labours to surprize  with looks affected and with riddling lyes  if he it is that bids thy love despair  i hope the happier end of all thy care  so far from truth his vain predictions fall  amint if ought thou knowst that may my hopes recall  conceal it not for great ive heard his fame  and feard his words thir when hither first i came  and in these shades the false imposter met  like thee i prizd and thought his judgment great  on all his studyd speeches still relyd  nor feard to err whilst led by such a guide  when on a day that busness and delight  my

there shalt thou meet  of soft enchantresses th enchantments sweet  who subtly will thy solid sense bereave  and a false gloss to evry object give  brass to thy sight as polishd gold shall seem  and glass thou as the diamond shalt esteem   huge heaps of silver to thee shall appear  which if approachd will prove but shining air  the very walls by magick art are wrought  and repitition to all speakers taught  not such as from our ecchoes we obtain  which only our last words return again  but speech for speech entirely there they give  and often add beyond what they receive  there downy couches to false rest invite  the lawn is charmd that faintly bars the light  no gilded seat no ivry board is there  but what thou mayst for some delusion fear  whilst farther to abuse thy wondring eyes  strange antick shapes before them shall arise  fantastick fiends that will about thee flock  and all they see with imitation mock  nor are these ills the worst thyself mayst be  transformd into a flame a stream a tree  a tear congeald by art thou mayst remain  till by a burning sigh dissolvd again   thus spake the wretch but coud not shake my mind  my way i take and soon the city find  where

enticing syrenes note  musick beyond the swans expiring throat  beyond the softest voice that charms the grove  and equald only by the spheres above  my ear i thought too narrow for the art  nor fast enough conveyd it to my heart  when in the entrance of the gate i saw  a man majestick and commanding awe  yet temperd with a carriage so refind  that undetermind was my doubtful mind  whether for

and tho brought back by my too envious stars  yet kept my voice and reed those lofty strains  and sent loud musick through the wondring plains  which mopsus hearing secretly malignd  and now to ruin both at once designd  which by his sorceries he soon brought to pass  and suddenly so cloggd and hoarse i was  that all our shepherds at the change amazd  believd i on some evningwolf had gazd  when

we of small proportion see  and slight the armed golden bee  yet if her sting behind she leaves  no ease th envenomd flesh receives  love less to sight than is this fly  in a soft curl conceald can lie  under an eyelids lovely shade  can form a dreadful ambuscade  can the most subtil sight beguile  hid in the dimples of a smile  but if from thence a dart he throw  how sure how mortal is the blow  how helpless all the powr of art  to bind or to restore the heart     from the aminta of tasso   part of the description of the golden age then by some fountains flowry side  the loves unarmd did still abide  then the loosd quiver careless hung  the torch extinct the bow unstrung  then by the nymphs no charms were worn  but such as with the nymphs were born  the shepherd coud not then complain

his glorious father died to gain  when the white warriors fled along the plain  when the full sails could not provoke the flood  till nicou came and swelld the seas with blood  slow at the end of his robust array  the mighty warrior pensive took his way  against the son of nair the young rorest  once the companion of his youthful breast  strong were the passions of the son of nair  strong as the tempest of the evening air  insatiate in desire fierce as the boar  firm in resolve as cannies rocky shore  long had the gods endeavourd to destroy  all nicous friendship happiness and joy  they

vicats right  he saw he lovd and burning with desire  bore the soft maid from brother sister sire  pining with sorrow nica faded died  like a fair alow in its morning pride  this brought the warrior to the bloody mead  and sent to young rorest the threatning reed  he drew his army forth oh need i tell  that nicou conquerd and the lover fell  his breathless army mantled all the plain  and death
